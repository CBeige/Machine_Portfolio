# Machine Portfolio
Welcome to my ML portfolio! The [Skills](Skills.md) are in this repo as well.

## Overview of ML
Here is my [Overview of ML](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## C++ Data Exploration
Here is my [report](C++_Data_Exploration.pdf) and [code](data_exploration.cpp)

## Linear Models
Here are my notebooks on [Regression](Regression.pdf) and [Classification](Classification.pdf)

## C++ ML Implementation
Here are my implementations for [NaiveBayes](NaiveBayes.cpp) and [LogReg](LogReg.cpp). Along with the [Report](C++_Implementation.pdf)

## Dimensionality Reduction
Here is my notebook on [dimensionality reduction](dim_red.pdf) methods.

## ML with sklearn
Here is my python notebook on [ML with sklearn](mlwithsklearn.pdf).

## Image Classification with Keras
Here is my notebook on [Image Classification using Keras](ImageClassification.pdf).

## Reflection Summary
Through this course I have gained experience implementing ML algorithms from scratch using C++, as well as utilizing popular frameworks such as R Markdown for building and executing models, and Tensorflow/Keras on Google Colab for training and validation. I now have proficiency in coding and data manipulation in several languages and platforms commonly used in the field. I believe that ML and AI holds immense potential for making our lives better. However, while there is no denying the benefits, we need to address serious concerns relating to the security aspects. In todayâ€™s world, AI is increasingly becoming central to critical infrastructure systems like power grids, communication networks, military defence systems etc. And if these systems can be hacked, then catastrophes could result. I aim to prrevent this by pursuing a career in securing AI systems. Cyber Security experts and AI researchers have to collaborate closely to ensure that all vulnerabilities are identified before hand rather than after an attack has already occurred. This is why the skills I learn in this class will benefit me in both respects.
